# In Memory Database
## How to Run the Project:
  - Make sure you have the JDK successfully installed on your computer
  - Note: You need to be able to compile and run Java
      - I'm using Intellij as my IDE and I downloaded the JDK before starting this project. You can use any IDE of your choice.
      - <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac">Link to download Intellij</a>
      - <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-mac">Link to download JDK</a>
  - Clone this project by using the git clone followed by the url
  - Open Terminal if your on a Mac or any command-line
  - cd into the project folder
  - cd into the src folder
  - run the command <span style="font-weight: bold">javac *  </span>in order to compile all the files
  - run the command <span style="font-weight: bold">java main.java </span>to run the file
  - you should see the list of outputs for each of the commands provided in the assignment instructions
    
## Future Assignment Recommendations:
 - The instructions of the assignment should include more tutorials on how a database works conceptually so that it would be easier for students to reinvent the wheel for an in memory database.
 - I would also include tutorials specific to each language such as C++, JavaScript, C# etc.
 - There should be a bit more clarity to how the code should be structured such as should multiple classes be used or different approaches or what data structures should be used.
 - More test cases should be provided than one instance just so that we can be sure that our code is accurate. I also think students should write their own test cases.
 - Students should record a demo video as well so its easiers for graders and include a detailed README.
